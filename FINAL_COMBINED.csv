The condition is not reversible, but progression may be slowed. Therapeutic foods for kidney conditions are designed to help reduce workload on the kidneys, enabling them to function more effectively. Dogs with decreased kidney function may experience loss of appetite and their food intake might decline. Hill's nutritionists and veterinarians developed Hill's Prescription Diet k/d clinical nutrition with ActivBiome+ Kidney Defense, a proprietary blend of prebiotics shown to nourish the gut microbiome to help support kidney function. This food has an irresistible taste that your dog will love.

The condition is not reversible, but progression may be slowed. Therapeutic foods for kidney conditions are designed to help reduce workload on the kidneys, enabling them to function more effectively. Dogs with decreased kidney function may experience loss of appetite and their food intake might decline. Hill's nutritionists and veterinarians developed Hill's Prescription Diet k/d clinical nutrition with ActivBiome+ Kidney Defense, a proprietary blend of prebiotics shown to nourish the gut microbiome to help support kidney function. Prescription Diet k/d is also formulated with Enhanced Appetite Trigger (E.A.T) to stimulate appetite and encourage food intake. This dry food has an irresistible taste that your dog will love. In fact, Prescription Diet k/d is clinically proven nutrition to improve & lengthen quality of life.

The condition is not reversible, but progression may be slowed, and taking action early can be beneficial. Dietetic foods for kidney conditions are designed to help reduce workload on the kidneys, enabling them to function more effectively. Dogs with decreased kidney function may experience loss of appetite and their food intake might decline.

Dogs that have adverse food reactions due to a food allergy (typically to a protein in the food) or intolerance benefit from a food designed for food sensitivities. Hill's nutritionists and veterinarians developed Prescription Diet z/d clinical nutrition especially formulated to support your dog's food sensitivities. In fact, z/d is clinically proven nutrition to reduce skin & digestive signs from food intolerances. Food sensitivities happen because proteins enter the skin and cross the digestive system to the body causing immune system to react. z/d is a specialized food with proteins that are gentle and broken into smaller pieces to help avoid detection by the immune system to help your dog feed better, prebiotics to create a healthy gut microbiome balance and fatty acids to build healthy skin. z/d is nutrition clinically proven to reduce skin & digestive signs from food intolerances which are the outward signs you see. Rest assured this product is working inside the pet to avoid the core issue which is due to an overactive immune reaction to certain foods.
