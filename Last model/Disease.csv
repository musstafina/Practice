489,Inherited nervous system disorders,Leukodystrophies,english foxhound,"The English Foxhound is the epitome of what serious dog breeders strive for: beauty, balance, and utility. “Next to an old Greek statue,” a poet wrote, “there are few such combinations of grace and strength as in a fine Foxhound.”These pack-oriented, scent-driven hounds are gentle and sociable, but rarely seen as house pets. They can be so driven by a primal instinct for pursuit that not much else, including training, matters to them. Owning these noble creatures is best left to huntsmen who kennel packs of hounds or to those experienced in meeting the special challenges of life with swift, powerful hounds hardwired for the chase. The English Foxhound is a substantial galloping hound of great stamina. His long legs are straight as a gatepost, and just as sturdy. The back is perfectly level.

894,Inherited cardiovascular disorders,Mitral valve dysplasia,pekingese,"Pekingese are compact, stocky toy dogs weighing up to 14 pounds. The coat is longest at the neck and shoulders, giving Pekes their famous “lion’s mane.” Coats come in various reds, from a golden-red to darker shades. The large, short-muzzled head is a wider-than-long “envelope shaped” rectangle, and the eyes are large, dark, and sparkly. A unique feature of Pekes is their effortless “rolling” gait.Pekes are charming, confident companions who develop a tight bond with their favorite human. Bred to live in palaces, they can be as serenely independent as the emperors who owned them. (They’re “opinionated,” Peke people say.) Ever alert, they make good watchdogs. Pekes will tolerate kids but won’t stand for a lot of roughhousing. The Pekingese, a compact toy companion of regal bearing and a distinctive rolling gait, is one of several breeds created for the ruling classes of ancient China.

The name Whippet is synonymous with streamlined grace.","Affectionate, Playful, Calm",61,45.72,55.88,11.33980925,18.1436948,12.0,15.0,Hound Group,0.2,Occasional Bath/Brush,0.4,Occasional,0.6,Regular Exercise,0.4,Independent,0.4,Reserved with Strangers
