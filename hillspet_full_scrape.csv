The condition is not reversible, but progression may be slowed. Therapeutic foods for kidney conditions are designed to help reduce workload on the kidneys, enabling them to function more effectively. Dogs with decreased kidney function may experience loss of appetite and their food intake might decline."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "Hill's Prescription Diet k/d Canine
