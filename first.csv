For best results:– We advise a gradual transition over 5-7 days for any new food. However, for dogs currently eating Prescription Diet g/d or low fat foods (e.g. Prescription Diet i/d Low Fat, i/d Stress, z/d Low Fat Soy, c/d Low Fat), we recommend gradually transitioning to this food over a period of 10-14 days.Be patient and consistent.– Exclusively feed the recommended Prescription Diet dry and wet foods.– Keep fresh water available at all times.– Have your veterinarian monitor your pet's condition.– To prevent suffocation, keep the packaging out of the reach of pets & children." ,                                                                                                                                                                           ,                                                                                                                                                                           , Dry Matter1%, 19.2 % , 12 %  , 59 %              , 4.2 %      , 0.8 %  , 0.4 %     , 0.99 %   , 0.22 %, 0.09 %   , 136 ppm  , 667 IU/kg , 1.33 %          ,                 ,      ,            ,           ,              , 0.25 % , 316.9 ppm,                  ,        ,            ,                    ,                    ,       ,        ,              ,                                           ,         ,           ,                      ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , 112 ppm, 7.5 ppm, 189 ppm, 2.98 ppm , 0.68 %
